# Efficient JS
A JavaScript developer tool for making the web more efficient and less carbon-emitting   

### The earth is facing a dangerous changing in the global climate. And CO2 contributing to damage it.

## Role of the Internet:

When a website is loaded, the energy used is proportional to the amount of data transferred. 
According to a source [WebsiteCarbon](https://www.websitecarbon.com), energy is used at the data centre is 48%, telecoms networks data transmitting is 14% and the end user's device is 38%. 

## Causing Factor:

But there is a big downside of jQuery. It slows down the website. To execute a function, the browser has to download and search through each line of code, which are thousands of lines of codes.


## What is the solution

This developer tools which transpiles jQuery code into basic Vanilla JavaScript code for better performance and less carbon emission.

## Performance comparison of websites created with jQuery and pure JavaScript

With jQuery | Without jQuery
